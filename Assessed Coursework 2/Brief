I believe that this project shows a good implementation of numerical methods to perform matrix algebra.
Though the project is not based on object orientated programming i think it shows a good foundation knowledge of
some functionality in C++. I believe the use of more advanced memory allocation highlights a good understanding of C++'s versatility.
